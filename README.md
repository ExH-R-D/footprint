# footprint

This defines a simple format, serialized using MPK, containing
"footprints".  A footprint is simply a multipolygonal area given in
WGS84 coordinates, representing a remote sensing satellite's pixel.

Converting footprint information from different satellites to
a common format makes it more convenient when looking for simultaneous
(coincident) observations.

A tool, `fptool`, allows merging different files, exporting the
footprints in GeoJSON format (with or without pretty-printing),
drawing them as SVG or dumping their contexts in human-readable text
form.
